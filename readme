Preparing the latest model for determining fraud apps by using the concept of sentimental analysis and machine learning on which mathematical model will be applied for better results. 
This will result in improved accuracy in less time. Security is also at risk in the age of modern technology, which is a significant issue. Numerous scam apps that endanger user data and privacy are among the apps
available in the Google App Store. When we used various factors to detect software fraud, our model performed perfectly. Using decision trees and sentiment analysis, we find counterfeit apps. 
This works well for in-game testing of malicious Play Store apps that are saved for security reasons. We also put up a fresh method for locating rival apps to a certain target app. 
First, we identified the key competitive criteria to do this. application domain to business domain. According to the total similarity score, we used weighted k-means clustering to divide the candidate apps 
for a certain app, make a cluster and find competing apps
